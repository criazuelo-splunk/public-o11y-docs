   :description: Ensure metadata keys are correct to enable full Related Content functionality.

The Related Content  feature automatically correlates data between different views within Splunk Observability Cloud by presenting related data at the bottom of the screen.

Select tiles in the Related Content bar to seamlessly navigate from one view to another in Observability Cloud. The following animation shows a user navigating from APM to Infrastructure Monitoring to Log Observer.

    :alt: Using Related Content in Observability Cloud.

In the preceding example, the user navigates through the following sequence:

1. The user starts in APM by exploring the service dependency map. They select the :strong:`Frontend` service because it shows a high error rate.

   In the Related Content bar at the bottom of the screen, the user sees a tile showing related EC2 instances and selects it.

2. Observability Cloud takes the user to Infrastructure where they click the first EC2 instance because it shows the highest CPU utilization. 

   In the Related Content bar, the user sees a tile showing logs related to the EC2 instance, so they click it.

3. Observability Cloud takes them to Log Observer where they can drill down into the related logs to find the root cause of the problem.

.. note::  Related Content is different from data links, a separate capability, which lets you dynamically transfer contextual information about the property you're viewing to the resource, helping you get to relevant information faster. To learn more about data links, see :ref:`apm-create-data-links`.

Prerequisites
=================================================================

Related Content relies on specific metadata that allow APM, Infrastructure Monitoring, and Log Observer to pass filters around Observability Cloud. 

The following sections list the metadata key names required to enable Related Content for each view in Observability Cloud. If your data does not have the field names listed here, Observability Cloud cannot correlate your related data.

APM
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following APM span tags are required to enable Related Content:

- ``service.name``
- ``deployment.environment``

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector already provides the span tags.

To learn more about deployment environments in Splunk APM, see :ref:`apm-environments`.

Infrastructure Monitoring
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following Infrastructure Monitoring metadata keys are required to enable Related Content:

- ``host.name``
- ``k8s.cluster.name``
- ``k8s.node.name``
- ``k8s.pod.name``
- ``container.id``
- ``k8s.namespace.name``
- ``kubernetes.workload.name``

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector already provides the Infrastructure Monitoring metadata.

Log Observer
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following metadata keys are required to enable Related Content for Log Observer:

- ``service.name``
- ``deployment.environment``
- ``host.name``
- ``trace_id``
- ``span_id``

Enable Related Content
=================================================================

See :ref:`get-started-enablerelatedcontent` to learn how you can make any necessary updates to metadata key names to enable Related Content in Observability Cloud.

Where can I see Related Content?
=================================================================

The following table describes when and where in Observability Cloud you can see Related Content:
